# Contributing to `MIPVerify`

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to `MIPVerify`.

## Getting Started

You will need to get started by [installing Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

### Basic Setup

If you are making changes to only documentation or tests — or are making changes to core
functionality that will be tested with unit tests — you can simply check out this repository and
start making changes.

### Advanced Setup

If you want to make changes to the `MIPVerify` package code, _and_ run an existing Julia script that
imports the package:

```sh
$ julia

julia>
```

Press `]` to enter the package manager

```sh
(@v1.4) pkg>
```

[Use `develop` to set up a git clone of the `MIPVerify` package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/#Pkg).

```sh
(@v1.4) pkg> develop --local MIPVerify
    Cloning git-repo `https://github.com/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl.git`
  Resolving package versions...
   Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`
 [e5e5f8be] + MIPVerify v0.2.3 [`dev/MIPVerify`]
   Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Manifest.toml`
  [6e4b80f9] + BenchmarkTools v0.5.0
  [a74b3585] + Blosc v0.7.0

  ...
```

You should now have the `MIPVerify` repository checked out at the path
`$JULIA_ENV_FOLDER/dev/MIPVerify`, where `JULIA_ENV_FOLDER` refers to the folder containing the
`Project.toml` file.

## Submitting Contributions

There are many ways to contribute to this package.

> Note: If you're new to Julia, consider working on one of the issues
> [labeled "good first issue"](https://github.com/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

### Contributing to core functionality

We're excited to hear what new ideas you have for verification, and would be happy to discuss how
best to implement it.

### Contributing datasets / networks

If you have an interesting new dataset, or a new network that you'll like to verify the robustness
of, please consider opening a PR to share it with other users of this package.

### Improving Documentation

We use [`Documenter.jl`](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/man/guide/), and
documentation is stored in the `docs/` directory.

Documentation is generated
[as part of the build process](https://github.com/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/2f2a0918abe28fb5f8b0b14396363c516a9c80c6/.travis.yml#L23-L28).

To generate documentation locally, run the following command from the `docs/` directory

```sh
julia --color=yes make.jl
```

The generated documentation will be found in the `docs/build/` directory.

### Writing Tests

Tests are stored in the `test/` directory, which has a parallel structure to the `src/` directory.

Information on current test coverage can be found
[on codecov](https://codecov.io/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl?branch=master).

Tests are run as part of the build process.

To run tests locally, run `julia --project=/path/to/repo/root`, enter the package manager, then run
`test MIPVerify`. (If running from the repository root, `julia --project` will suffice). Sample
output:

```sh
(@v1.4) pkg> test MIPVerify
   Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`

   ...

    Testing MIPVerify
Status `/tmp/jl_rbadNV/Manifest.toml`
  [6e4b80f9] BenchmarkTools v0.5.0
  [b99e7846] BinaryProvider v0.5.10

   ...

Test Summary: | Pass  Total
MIPVerify     |  336    336
    Testing MIPVerify tests passed
```

For faster iteration, you can also run individual test files in `/test` via
`julia --project=test test/my_test.jl`.

## Getting your PR ready to merge

For your PR to be reviewed, it will need to pass two required checks:

### `JuliaFormatter / format-check (pull_request)`

This check verifies that the code formatting is aligned with our specifications. Running the script
[`scripts/format.sh`](scripts/format.sh) locally will make changes to ensure that your code is up to
spec.

### `Travis CI - Pull Request`

This check verifies that tests were all passing and documentation was generated successfully.

### Non-required checks

Two additional checks (`codecov/patch` and `codecov/project`) measure the change in code coverage in
the project. They are generally used to verify that any new core functionality is properly tested.
