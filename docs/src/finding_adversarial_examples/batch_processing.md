# Batch Processing

[`batch_find_untargeted_attack`](@ref) enables users to run [`find_adversarial_example`](@ref) for
multiple samples from a single dataset, writing 1) a single summary `.csv` file for the dataset,
with a row of summary results per sample, and 2) a file per sample containing the output dictionary
from [`find_adversarial_example`](@ref).

[`batch_find_untargeted_attack`](@ref) allows verification of a dataset to be resumed if the process
is interrupted by intelligently determining whether to rerun [`find_adversarial_example`](@ref) on a
sample based on the `solve_rerun_option` specified.
