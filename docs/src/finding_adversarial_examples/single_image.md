[`find_adversarial_example`](@ref) finds the closest adversarial example to a given input image for
a particular [`NeuralNet`](@ref).

As a sanity check, we suggest that you verify that the [`NeuralNet`](@ref) imported achieves the
expected performance on the test set. This can be done using [`frac_correct`](@ref).
