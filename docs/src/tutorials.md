# Tutorials

We suggest getting started with the tutorials.

## Quickstart

[A basic demonstration](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/master/examples/00_quickstart.ipynb)
on how to find adversarial examples for a pre-trained example network on the MNIST dataset.

## Importing your own neural net

[Explains](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/master/examples/01_importing_your_own_neural_net.ipynb)
how to import your own network for verification.

## Finding adversarial examples, in depth

[Discusses](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/master/examples/02_finding_adversarial_examples_in_depth.ipynb)
the various parameters you can select for `find_adversarial_example`. We explain how to

- Better specify targeted labels for the perturbed image (including multiple targeted labels)
- Have more precise control over the activations in the output layer
- Restrict the family of perturbations (for example to the blurring perturbations discussed in our
  paper)
- Select whether you want to minimize the $L_1$, $L_2$ or $L_\infty$ norm of the perturbation.
- Modify the amount of time dedicated to building the model (by selecting the
  `tightening_algorithm`, and/or passing in custom `tightening_options`).

For Gurobi, we show how to specify optimizer settings to:

- Mute output
- Terminate early if:
  - A time limit is reached
  - Lower bounds on robustness are proved (that is, we prove that no adversarial example can exist
    closer than some threshold)
  - An adversarial example is found that is closer to the input than expected
  - The gap between the upper and lower objective bounds falls below a selected threshold

## Interpreting the output of `find_adversarial_example`

[Walks you through](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/master/examples/03_interpreting_the_output_of_find_adversarial_example.ipynb)
the output dictionary produced by a call to `find_adversarial_example`.

## Managing log output

[Explains how](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl/blob/master/examples/04_managing_log_output.ipynb)
to get more granular log settings and to write log output to file.
